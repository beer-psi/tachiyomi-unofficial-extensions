# Nguồn Cứu Truyện

Check update ở mục [Releases](https://github.com/beerpiss/tachiyomi-unofficial-extensions/releases), [tạo issue](https://github.com/beerpiss/tachiyomi-unofficial-extensions/issues/new/choose) nếu có vấn đề.

Khi cài đặt, có thể sẽ có cảnh báo về Google Play Protect, điều này là bình thường do Google chưa công nhận chữ ký số của tôi 😭. Sau khi cài đặt, vào mục Tiện ích mở rộng và chọn tin cậy.

Vui lòng cân nhắc rủi ro trước khi sử dụng nguồn không chính thức.

# ![app icon](./.github/readme-images/app-icon.png)Tachiyomi Extensions
Tachiyomi is a free and open source manga reader for Android 6.0 and above.

This repository contains the available extension catalogues for the [Tachiyomi](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi) app.

# Usage

Extension sources can be downloaded, installed, and uninstalled via the main Tachiyomi app. They are installed and uninstalled like regular apps, in `.apk` format.

## Downloads

If you prefer to directly download the APK files, they are available via https://tachiyomi.org/extensions/ or directly in this GitHub repository in the [`repo` branch](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi-extensions/tree/repo/apk).

# Requests

Source requests here are meant as up-for-grabs for any developer, thus it's impossible to provide a time estimation for any of them. Furthermore, some sites are impossible to do, usually because of various technical reasons.

# Contributing
